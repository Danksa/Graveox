# Graveox

Graveox is a simulation program or rather a game in which you can experiment with objects in a gravitational field. It is written in Java and it uses the JavaFX framework which is included in Java 8.

Keep in mind, I create this program "just for fun" for the learning experience.

Feel free to do anything with the code you like!

## Features

#### Already implemented ones
- Newtonian gravity
- Relativistic gravity (inaccureate using schwartzschild effective potential)
- Deleting objects
- Dragging the camera
- Zooming
- Trails
- Basic collision

#### Upcoming ones

- Adding objects
    - flinging them
    - place them in stable circular orbit
- View information about objects
- More accurate collisions
    - Merging when colliding
    - Bouncing off when colliding
- More relativistic features
    - Speed of light as speed limit
    - Length contraction and aberration

## Usage

Use your favourite Java IDE and compile the source.
I'll add pre-compiled .jar files in the future.
